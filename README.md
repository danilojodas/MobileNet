# MobileNet
This repository contains the implementation of the MobileNet Convolutional Neural Network developed in Python programming language. The provided source-code contains two functions that represent the implementations of the MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 architectures.

## Experiments
A MobileNetV1 network was developed to identify images of the airplane models Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. A dataset with over 2000 images of each airplane model was created to train the CNN model. Another dataset with over 300 images of each airplane model was also create to validate the performance of network.

The training dataset contains 2442 images of the Airbus A320 model and 2309 images of the Boeing 737. The validation dataset contains 487 images of the Airbus A320 and 335 images of the Boeing 737.

**Obs: Unfortunatley it is not possible to provide the images used in the training and validation of the network due to the Copyright policy. However, the trained model is available for further refinement.**

### Training and validation loss
The following plots depict the training and validation loss resulting from the training process of the MobileNet model.
